# Roadmap

It's not yet a roadmap, but we're starting to collect community knowledge around cross-chain bridging solutions and we might form a roadmap out of it.

Check out [our list of cross-chain bridging solutions](https://github.com/lifinance/roadmap/blob/main/CROSS-CHAIN-BRIDGING-SOLUTIONS.md) and add what we're missing.


# About LI.FI

[LI.FI](http://li.fi) is a cross-chain liquidity aggregation protocol and is building a crucial infrastructure piece for the mass-adoption of blockchains. Abstracting away DeFi and making it available as API and widget to the dapplication layer, empowers developers to focus on what is truly important: building value bringing, decentralized applications for the consumer. LI.FI allows limitless, cross-chain any-to-any swaps from anywhere, directly into dapps.
